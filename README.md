# Command-Line Project Ideas

Welcome to the Command-Line Project Ideas repository! This repository contains a collection of simple to intermediate projects designed to help you practice and strengthen your programming skills. These projects are great for beginners and cover a range of concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, user input, file handling, and more.

## Project List

### 1. Calculator
**Description:** Build a basic calculator that can perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project will give you practice with functions and control flow.

### 2. Number Guessing Game
**Description:** Develop a game where the program randomly selects a number, and the user has to guess it. The program provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low. This project helps you understand loops and conditional statements.

### 3. Unit Converter
**Description:** Build a unit converter that can convert between different units of measurement (e.g., kilometers to miles, Celsius to Fahrenheit). This project will strengthen your understanding of functions and user input.

### 4. Password Generator
**Description:** Develop a password generator that creates random, secure passwords based on user-defined criteria (e.g., length, inclusion of special characters). This project will help you understand random number generation and string handling.

### 5. Word Counter
**Description:** Create a program that counts the number of words, characters, and lines in a given text file. This project will give you experience with file I/O operations and string manipulation.

### 6. To-Do List
**Description:** Create a simple to-do list application where users can add, remove, and mark tasks as complete. This project will help you practice working with lists and user input.

### 7. Simple Quiz
**Description:** Create a quiz application that asks the user multiple-choice questions and provides feedback on their answers. This will help you practice working with lists, conditionals, and user input.

### 8. Contact Book
**Description:** Design a command-line application to store and manage contacts. Users should be able to add, view, and delete contacts. This will help you practice working with data structures like lists or dictionaries.
